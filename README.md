# FUS Protein Mammal Variation Viewer

### To View Spatial Variation of FUS protein follow this link:

### Project: 

### Description: This visualization displays amino acid variations found in publically available mammal fus protein sequences. This circular view of the variation data allows for a visual seqmentation of the location of high and low amounts of variation. A visual segmentation raises questions about local conservation of amino acid sequences and/or regional functionality in the progression of ALS.

### Layer ONE: Divides the primary structure of the fus protein into each amino acid location by regions within the protein.
### Layer TWO: The Amino acid single letter abbreviation and location within the primary structure.
### Layer THREE: The Amino acid substitutions found from clinical ALS data.

### When highlighting amino acid locations, the amino acid location as well as the number of mammals found with an amino acid variation at that location is displayed in the center of the visualization.
